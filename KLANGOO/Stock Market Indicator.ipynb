Between the lack of contact and the visa, is Bert done with him?\", 'content': 'It’s been three years since Seeking Sister Wife star, Garrick Merrifield began courting Roberta ‘Bert’ Pache as a second wife and she’s still not in the United States. Many Seeking Sister Wife fans think Bert has already given up on the Merrifields. Here are the 3 reasons why Seeking Sister Wife fans think Bert already dumped Garrick and his wife, Dannielle Merrified. Dannielle Merrifield, Garrick Merrifield, and Roberta Pache, ‘Seeking Sister Wife’ | TLC Bert is contacting with Garrick and Dannielle less and less The first clue that Seeking Sister Wife fans noticed was that Bert seemed to be pulling away from Garrick and Dannielle. As discussed in season 4, they haven’t gone to see Brazilian-born Bert in over a year. On the July 11 episode of Seeking Sister Wife, Dannielle said, “Roberta’s been dealing with a lot the past year.” She explains that between getting sick with coronavirus (COVID-19) and caretaking for her aging mother, she’s had a tough time. Dannielle said that Bert’s lack of internet or cell service in Brazil has taken its toll on all of their relationships. She said, “The communication definitely changed.” Garrick adds, “Dramatically.” Bert was upset about Garrick dating a new potential wife, Lea When Dannielle suggested that Garrick start looking for more wives to add to the family, he didn’t hesitate to start dating. Roberta, however, was not on board with this new plan. The original idea was to give Roberta time to settle into life in Colorado with the Merrifield before they start adding more wives. Alone time with Garrick is important to Bert, since they’ve spent the majority of their relationship in separate countries. So when Garrick began dating Lea, she was not happy, which is another reason why fans think Bert and Garrick are done. Dannielle said, “Roberta was uncomfortable at the idea of us dating someone while were dating her.” Dannielle had mentioned that adding a third wife could be hard on Bert, noting how she is “insecure and jealous” and doesn’t like to share Garrick. In the\\xa0trailer\\xa0for\\xa0Seeking Sister Wife\\xa0Season 4, Roberta gets angry at the idea of Garrick being intimate with Lea. She says, “No kisses. Friends.” Luckily for Bert, Lea ended her relationship with Garrick, so she doesn’t have to worry about her fiancé stealing kisses anymore. Bert is in no rush to go to the US with the Merrifields The final clue that suggests that Bert dumped Garrick is how relaxed she is about getting her visa. In previous seasons, the Merrifields tried to get Bert to the US on a tourist visa, but it was denied. Which led them to pursue a K-1 or fiancé visa. This visa gives Garrick 90 days once Bert is in the US to marry her, or she will have to return to Brazil. With Bert’s visa approved, all she has to do is pick up her passport and visa from a government building. However, the visa does have an exploration date and it’s coming up quickly. Dannielle explained, “Our immigration lawyers made it very clear that, she can’t wait ’til the last minute, because travel and flights are limited. So she only has a short period of time to get here.” Dannielle doesn’t believe that Roberta is aware of how time-sensitive this process is. She said, “She doesn’t have much longer.” Fans will have to watch the rest of Seeking Sister Wife Season 4 to find out if Bert makes it to the US. But according to the trailer, Dannielle and Garrick travel to meet her in a beach location. Seeking Sister Wife\\xa0airs Mondays at 10 pm EST on TLC and discovery+.

Seri Alam police chief Superintendent Mohd Sohaimi Ishak said a police criminal investigation department (CID) team was alerted to an incident yesterday. “Acting on information, at 6.07pm, a CID team from the Seri Alam district police headquarters arrested five local youths around the Pasir Gudang area. “The suspects were between the ages of 20 and 32. Checks found that three of the suspects had four previous criminal records. “Police managed to solve the case in less than 24 hours after the victim lodged a police report,” said Mohd Sohaimi in a statement issued here today. Earlier, Mohd Sohaimi said police had acted based on a report lodged by the 23-year-old male victim who was beaten before being robbed by a group of men at a flat here yesterday. He said the incident happened at 4.05am beneath the block of flats when he was walking home alone. “The victim was beaten by a group of unarmed suspects before the victim’s personal belongings were taken from him. “The stolen items included a Vivo V2 mobile phone, a wallet containing the victim’s identity card and SG$460 (RM1,449) in cash. “As a result of the incident, the victim suffered injuries to his lips and discomfort in his right shoulder,” he said. Mohd Sohaimi said the case was being investigated under Section 394 of the Penal Code and if convicted, could see the accused sentenced to imprisonment for a term of up to 20 years and a fine or whipping. “All suspects have been remanded for five days from July 13 to July 17,” he said.', 'pubDate': '2022-07-13 07:44:51', 'image_url': None, 'source_id': 'malaymail', 'country': ['singapore', 'malaysia'], 'category': ['top'], 'language': 'english'}, {'title': 'Who is Denise Van Outen’s boyfriend Jimmy Barba?', 'link': 'https://www.thesun.ie/tvandshowbiz/9091101/denise-van-outen-boyfriend-jimmy-barba/', 'keywords': ['Showbiz', 'Celebrity Relationships', 'Explainers'], 'creator': ['Joanne Kavanagh'], 'video_url': None, 'description': 'DENISE Van Outen has a new boyfriend on her arm who has a reality TV past – AND appeared in an iconic music video.

The DOH reiterated the importance of booster shots as the effectiveness of the two-dose primary vaccination series wanes over time. “Immunity does not last forever, and for that reason, we must all get a booster,” the state health agency said in an advisory. “The likelihood to be very ill or worse, to die, is what matters. Given this information, the choice to be vaccinated and protected from this risk becomes clear,” it added. The DOH said that based on data, “six out of ten Covid-19 patients seen at the hospital are not fully vaccinated.“ “The remaining four out of ten who are fully vaccinated or even boosted are more likely to be asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases who were also seen at the hospital,” it added. Severe and critical symptoms are 1.48 times “more likely to happen” among people who are not vaccinated at all as compared to those who have completed the primary vaccine series, the DOH said. It was also noted by the DOH that unvaccinated individuals are 1.86 times “more likely to die from Covid-19, compared to those who have completed their primary series.” “The DOH repeats in no uncertain terms: Covid-19 vaccines save lives,” the agency said. Aside from vaccination, the DOH also reminded the public to strictly follow the health protocols as daily cases nationwide are projected to increase to at least 17,000 to 22,000 by the end of this month. “National daily cases may reach up to 17,105 by the end of July if current MPHS (minimum public health standards) compliance is maintained,” it said. “If MPHS further declines, along with other factors contributing to higher transmission rates such as lowered vaccination effective coverage and higher mobility, cases may be as high as 22,187,” it added. In Metro Manila, cases could go up as high as 11,186 per day by the end of July, the DOH said. Currently, the average number of daily cases in the Philippines is at 1,467.

But she made obvious the the truth during a recent interview. Asked if she’s open to the possibility of falling in love again and entering a new relationship, she hastily replied, “Hindi po muna.” Rabiya maintained she is now more keen focusing on her career rather than love for the time being. Note she was tapped as host of the upcoming GMA show “TicktoClock,” along with Kim Atienza and Pokwang. According to Rabiya, the two advised her that focusing on work is the best thing she could do at this point in her life. “Palagi nila sa aking sinasabi na ‘Ano mang nangyayari sayo ngayon, sobrang blessed ka na at your age na nandito ka sa spot na to.’ At dun din po muna ang focus ko,” she related. In the same interview, Rabiya talked about how she handles challenges. She said: “Hindi naman po talaga maiiwasan na magkaproblema sa buhay e. That’s part of life pero it’s also mental game e. Kung paano mo siya iha-handle.” The Ilongga beauty queen believes one should always get up after falling down. “Totoo po talaga yung once na nadapa ka, bumangon ka at magpaka-busy ka. There so much to life that you could celebrate. At hindi dahil may problema ka, dadalhin \\xa0mo yun sa trabaho mo at maapektuhan yung trabaho mo.” She related how it boils down to being thankful. “You have to be grateful because there’s a lot of artists who wanna have that spot,” the beauty queen-turned-actress said. Rabiya deemed showbiz a “competitive industry.” So, her having a hosting gig just after making her acting debut is a “privilege.” “It’s privilege. It’s a blessing. We need to be grateful for it,” she said. “Despite everything, I’m very much grateful kasi I have Mamang and Kuya Kim na even off-cam, they would guide me on things I have to do, things that I don’t need to do.

We asked help from a Filipino gastro diplomat', 'content': 'Editor’s note: #RapplerReads is a project by the BrandRap team. We earn a commission every time you shop through the affiliate links below. When in a new place, there’s one thing Filipinos love to do: Eat the best local dish they can find. For most of us, food is the gateway to any new culture whether local or international. For example, a trip to my hometown Pampanga wouldn’t be complete without a visit to the best sisig restaurant in town. That’s according to all my friends who travel around two hours just to eat authentic Kapampangan sisig and have coffee and dessert at the numerous cafes in Clark.\\xa0 The strong link between food and identity has long been the subject of a lot of scholarly articles and journals. But this month on #RapplerReads, I wanted to unpack it even further by talking to someone who has a lot of firsthand experience with it.\\xa0 Meet Raf Ignacio, host of Filipino Food Crawl I first discovered Raf Ignacio’s website when I was looking for copies of several Filipino books on food. Through the site, readers can purchase just about any kind of literature – be it a cookbook or a book about food history – related to Filipino food. But he isn’t just a seller of books. He’s also a host of the Filipino food experience.\\xa0 Born and raised in the Philippines, Ignacio has also lived in Japan, Malaysia, and India. He moved to New York in 2014, where he launched Filipino Food Crawl.\\xa0 Ignacio shared that he started hosting Filipino food tours in New York City in 2018. He saw it as his own way to introduce Filipino cuisine to curious tourists and Filipino-Americans looking to connect with their roots.\\xa0 “For two and half hours, I took my guests to eat at different Filipino restaurants in the East Village while telling them stories about Philippine culture and history. However, because of the pandemic, I had to put a hold on hosting. I decided to pivot from tours to offering Filipino books on food and culture through my online store,” he said in an email interview.\\xa0\\xa0 As his tours became more popular, Ignacio was tapped for collaborations with various brands. These were all focused on introducing Filipino food and culture to more people, both local and international.\\xa0 I’ve always been an advocate of Filipino culture and I believe that for someone to truly appreciate a culture, one has to experience it. To me, food has become a tool to let others experience Filipino culture.Raf Ignacio So what can this self-proclaimed Filipino gastro diplomat say about food and identity? A lot. Read below for our conversation. What has been the best thing about the Filipino Food Crawl? I enjoy having the opportunity to share experiences and stories about Filipino cuisine with those who are interested and with those who want to reconnect with their Filipino roots. It is satisfying to me to hear someone say that they were able to learn more about themselves through the food that they tried on the tour. I’m glad to be a part of this (re)discovery of one’s Filipino identity and culture. You’ve also been busy working with brands like Goldilocks and Buzzfeed. Can you share a memorable experience from any collaboration? I have collaborated with Goldilocks on two #EATymology series in which we talked about the origins of the names of some of Goldilocks’ best-selling pastries and bread. BuzzFeed chose to feature Filipino Food Crawl (the tour) in its travel and experiences channel called BringMe. The collaboration with BuzzFeed was fun because it was the first time for me to be featured by a major publication. The final product came out extremely well! The link between food and memory is well-documented, with many agreeing that food is an invoker of memory. In your personal experience, is there any Filipino food that really takes you back to a specific memory? Sisig! The first dish I eat whenever I visit the Philippines is sisig. I love its flexibility – one can eat sisig by itself as a pulutan [food eaten with alcohol] or with rice as an ulam [viand] – and its origin story – discarded pig heads were reimagined to become a delicious and one-of-a-kind dish. This story shows Filipino creativity and our penchant to maximize all our available resources.\\xa0 Play Video As a Filipino living in the US, do you think food affects your Filipino identity? Why or why not? Yes, I think Filipino food has allowed me to express my Filipino identity in a society that’s unfamiliar with my experience as a migrant. I see food as a conversation starter. With each bite, there’s an opportunity to talk about different aspects of Filipino daily life as well as our colonial history. Food also lets me talk about the richness and varieties of our cuisine, including the different regional/provincial interpretations of the same dish. If you could suggest either a list or one book on food that all Filipinos should read, what would they/it be?\\xa0 I highly recommend Tikim: Essays on Philippine Food and Culture by Doreen Fernandez, the pioneer of Filipino food literature. It’s a collection of essays that will give the reader an introduction to the intricate nuances of Filipino food culture through its people, places, and flavors.\\xa0 Another favorite of mine is The Governor-General’s Kitchen by Felice Sta. Maria. This well-researched book covers little-known stories on Philippine culinary culture from the time of the Spanish and the Americans, including some recipes from that time period.\\xa0 Interested in discovering more about the Filipino identity through food? If you’re in New York City and are looking for Ignacio’s own spin on the Filipino food experience, stay tuned because he mentioned that there’s a possibility he would start holding tours again in the future.\\xa0 But for now, find your next favorite read through his online store. – Rappler.com Get it on Shopee', 'pubDate': '2022-07-13 07:35:15', 'image_url': None, 'source_id': 'rappler', 'country': ['philippines'], 'category': ['top'], 'language': 'english'}, {'title': 'Portable ultrasound equipment market, Evolving Opportunities with Canon Inc. and Clarius Mobile Health Corp - Technavio', 'link': 'https://www.prnewswire.com:443/news-releases/portable-ultrasound-equipment-market-evolving-opportunities-with-canon-inc-and-clarius-mobile-health-corp---technavio-301584880.html', 'keywords': ['Health Care & Hospitals', 'Medical Equipment', 'Medical Pharmaceuticals', 'MEQ', 'HEA', 'MTC'], 'creator': None, 'video_url': None, 'description': 'NEW YORK, July 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Portable Ultrasound Equipment Market is expected to grow by USD 1.58 billion at a CAGR of 13.3% during the forecast period.

The post 'Creative midfielder': Sky reporter drops exciting Tottenham transfer claim on top of Spence appeared first on HITC.\", 'content': \"Michael Bridge has claimed that Tottenham Hotspur plan to make ‘three more signings’ this summer, including Djed Spence, as he told Sky Sports. One of the areas Spurs seemingly want to try and fill before the 2022 summer window slams shut is bringing in a ‘creative midfielder’, after previously looking at Christian Eriksen, who has now decided to join Manchester United. Up until now, the work Fabio Paratici and Daniel Levy have done from the boardroom has been pretty impressive and one that has already filled up Tottenham’s squad. Photo by Tottenham Hotspur FC/Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images There does seem to be this delay with this Spence transfer, but it’s probably only a matter of time before the promotion-winning star is being put through his paces in South Korea. Nonetheless, with five new faces already through the transfer doors at Tottenham, Bridge dropped an exciting claim about how the Champions League-bound side aren’t stopping there. “I think around two or three more signings,” said Bridge. “Djed Spence is widely known. They want another wing-back. They are still negotiating a fee with Middlesbrough. The player wants to come. “I think they want a more attack-minded central midfielder. Someone a bit more creative. I thought maybe at the start of the summer, it would have been Christian Eriksen. “But it seems as though Eriksen is looking for a ‘new challenge’ and Spurs isn’t a ‘new challenge’ for him.” Photo by Tottenham Hotspur FC/Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images CREATIVE PLAYER NEEDED This is one area of the pitch that has been a problem ever since Tottenham parted ways with Eriksen back in 2020, with several players, such as Giovanni Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele failing to make their mark. Harry Kane has been the one who has dropped deep and made the ball talk, but bringing in that specialist creative brain would solve a number of issues. Not only would it provide Antonio Conte with something different to what he already has in his midfield, but it also eases the pressure on England’s captain. The key thing here is that would Levy be willing to put serious cash on the table for that attack-minded midfielder? The Spurs chairman has already backed Conte in that regard, but it will be interesting to see how far they push for that much-needed attacking midfielder.
