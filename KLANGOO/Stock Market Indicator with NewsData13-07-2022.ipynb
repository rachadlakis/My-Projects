Bitcoin Saw Another Low Last week went positively for the primary cryptocurrency, which spiked to nearly $22,500 to mark a three-week high. However, that leg up was short-lived, and the asset began retracing shortly after. Once the weekend came, bitcoin had calmed in a range between $21,000 and $22,000 and spent most of it there as the trading volume was missing. On Monday, though, BTC started to lose value rapidly and came just inches away from breaking below $20,000. While the bulls defended that price tag at first, the asset ultimately dropped below it on Tuesday. The past 24 hours brought a bit more pain as bitcoin slipped to $19,200, which is a new 9-day low. As of now, though, it has recovered some ground and stands close to $20,000. Its market cap is back at $375 billion, while its dominance over the alts is just under 43%. BTCUSD.

Altcoins Stall, Ape Soars The alternative coins also went down in the past few days, but they have calmed on a daily scale. Ethereum stood above $1,250 at a multi-week high of its own last week but lost $200 in days. As of now, the second-largest crypto trades at just over $1,050. BNB went from over $240 to below $220 in the same timeframe, but a minor daily increase has pushed the asset to $226 as of now. Ripple, Solana, Polkadot, Tron, Shiba Inu, and LEO are also slightly in the green today. Cardano and Dogecoin, on the other hand, have charted insignificant declines. Most lower- and mid-cap alts are also quite calm. ApeCoin is among the few impressive gainers with a 6% daily increase. Consequently, APE trades just over $4.5. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Ripple, Solana, Polkadot, Tron, Shiba Inu, and LEO are also slightly in the green today. Cardano and Dogecoin, on the other hand, have charted insignificant declines. Most lower- and mid-cap alts are also quite calm. ApeCoin is among the few impressive gainers with a 6% daily increase. Consequently, APE trades just over $4.5. Cryptocurrency Market Overview. Source: Quantify Crypto Industry News The European Central Bank released guidance, proposing a ban on crypto mining and enhanced regulations on stablecoins. 3AC’s co-founder Zhu Su broke his silence and called the recent court filing “disappointing.” Uniswap users were targeted in a phishing attack that resulted in over $8 million in ETH stolen.\n",

      "Text nb: 3 is:  Digital asset and crypto investment products saw a second consecutive week of negligible inflows this past week, amounting to $15 million. These inflows enabled total crypto assets under management (AuM) to recover from their year-and-a-half lows to $36.2 billion, according to the latest CoinShares report. While still positive, these inflows were even lower than the week prior’s $64 million. Regionally, North American saw the majority of inflows. For instance, U.S. crypto exchanges saw inflows amounting to $8.2 million, with 76% notably comprising short positions. Additionally, Canada saw inflows of $7.1 million. Among European countries, Switzerland stood alone with inflows of $1.9 million. Similar to last week, inflows into short-Bitcoin products outmatched those for long-Bitcoin products some $6.3 million to $1.7 million. The week prior, short-Bitcoin investment products saw a record $61 ​​million in inflows. However, according to the report, “short position inflows are beginning to cool off, while recent price appreciation in Bitcoin prices has pushed down AuM down from a peak of $140 million to $127 million last week.” Meanwhile, Ethereum-based products saw inflows for a third consecutive week totaling $7.6 million. Following 11 consecutive weeks of outflows, this three-week run suggests a modest turnaround in sentiment, according to the report. At its peak, year-to-date outflows for Ethereum-based products amounted to $460 million. The report ascribed the improved sentiment to the increasing probability of the Merge, in which Ethereum will migrate from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake protocol, which has been years in the making. Multi-asset investment products have seen a similar short term change of luck. While these products had only experienced minor outflows during two weeks of the year so far, last week they say minor outflows amounting to $2.2 million. Other altcoin-based products have remained remarkably inactive this month so far, with minor outflows totalling $300,000.

      "Text nb: 4 is:  Bitcoin (BTC) is close to breaking down from a corrective pattern that had been in place since June 18. If this occurs, it would be expected to lead to new lows. Sponsored Sponsored Bitcoin has been falling underneath a descending resistance line since the end of March. The line caused a rejection on June 7, which led to a local bottom of $17,622 on June 18. Sponsored Sponsored The price increased slightly since and created two higher lows. However, it failed to even reach the descending resistance line and was instead rejected by the $21,700 horizontal resistance area. The daily RSI has yet to move above 50 and was rejected by the line the same time as the price was rejected by the $21,700 horizontal level. On the other hand, the RSI is still holding on above its ascending trendline (green). A breakdown from the line would likely confirm that the price is heading lower. BTC/USDT Chart By TradingView Short-term breakdown A closer look at the six-hour chart paints a mostly bearish outlook. Firstly, the price has been trading inside an ascending parallel channel since June 18. Such channels usually contain corrective structures, meaning that an eventual breakdown would be expected. Secondly, the six-hour RSI has broken down from its ascending trendline and is below 50. BTC/USDT Chart By TradingView BTC wave count The wave count suggests that BTC has been trading in a five-wave downward move (yellow) since the end of March. The presence of this structure makes it likely that BTC is currently in wave four. If it breaks down, a likely target for the bottom would be found at $16,725. This target is found using the 0.382 length of waves 1-3. BTC/USDT Chart By TradingView The long-term wave count suggests that BTC is in the C wave of an A-B-C corrective structure (red) that has been developing since the all-time high of $69,000 was reached in November 2021. Giving waves A and C a 1:1 ratio would lead to a long-term low of $12,100, given that the $16,726 level fails.

      "Text nb: 5 is:  It comes as no surprise that the central bank wants to curtail crypto as much as it possibly can, advising EU lawmakers with a recent research paper. On July 12, crypto venture advisor at Presight Capital, Patrick Hansen, broke down the report, which focused primarily on what the ECB considers financial risks. It acknowledged that the digital asset markets were evolving rapidly, claiming that if current trends continue, “crypto-assets will pose risks to financial stability,” therefore need to be “effectively regulated and supervised.” The three areas of concern for the central bankers were the climate risk of crypto, decentralized finance, and stablecoins. The ECB has published 3 new research articles on • Climate risk of crypto • DeFi • Stablecoins They give a good overview of how the ECB thinks about these issues and contain some remarkable quotes and graphs. A few examples https://t.co/KDO5NC9cqF pic.twitter.com/lSxhLUI5jt — Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) July 12, 2022 A ‘Probable’ Mining Ban The first concern was one regarding the climate, with the report stating that there is a choice between “incentivizing the crypto version of the electric vehicle” or banning the fossil fuel version. This refers to the choice of proof-of-stake, which Ethereum is about to switch to, instead of proof-of-work, which runs the Bitcoin network. The ECB stated that public authorities are “highly unlikely” to take a hands-off approach, so: “Policy action by authorities (e.g. disclosure requirements, carbon tax on crypto transactions or holdings, or outright bans on mining) is probable.” The next swipe was at DeFi, with the ECB pointing out that most protocols were actually centralized. It used Uniswap as an example claiming the team, early investors, and whales control it, “1% of the total token holder addresses hold around 97% of the total token supply.” In essence, this is precisely what a central bank does with its tight leash of control over a nation’s currency, so this point could be considered moot. Unstable Stablecoins The next attack was on stablecoins, which the ECB has been trying to veto since early 2021, making the obvious example out of the Terra ecosystem and its recent collapse. “Recent developments show that stablecoins are anything but stable, as exemplified by the crash of TerraUSD and the temporary de-pegging of Tether.” The report stated that stablecoins need to be “brought into the regulatory perimeter with urgency,” adding that the EU’s proposed MiCA laws need to be implemented urgently. The central bank failed to make the comparison between their volatility and the rampant devaluation and instability of fiat currencies due to economic policy meddling and money printing mechanisms. Just this week, the Euro reached parity with the USD for the first time in almost two decades.
